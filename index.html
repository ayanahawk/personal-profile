                    <span>Food Oasis </span>was made for users to know where the nearest produce and farmers markets are
                    in
                    their zip code. For this app, I worked on managing the data of the different grocery stores and
                    still managing new and upcoming farmer markets and community gardens. A new goal for this app is to
                    be able to find local food banks and enter them into the database as well.

                    <span> Electra</span> is an app I am currently working on during my time with Talent Path. It is an
                    app where
                    artists in LA can build community by uploading files of their art and able
                    to receive critiques and comments of their work. The goal of this app is it to be the “Stack
                    Overflow” of the art scene in LA where people can get insight and advice from other local artists. I
                    took on different hats for this app working on the frontend with React and server side with Node and
                    Express.
