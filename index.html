                    <span>Food Oasis </span>
                    was made for users to know where the nearest produce and farmers markets are located
                    in their neighborhoods. For this app, I worked on the frontend usng HTML, CSS, and Javascript for
                    different UI functionalities. I also managed data of the different grocery stores and upcoming
                    farmer markets and community gardens. As I am still a part of Food Oasis, a near goal is to
                    to find local food banks and enter them into the database as well.

                    <span> Electra</span> (still in production) is the app I am currently working on during my time with
                    Talent Path. The goal of this app is it to be the “Stack
                    Overflow” of the art scene in LA. Artist can can get insight and advice from other local artists
                    about thier work. I
                    took on different hats for this app working on the frontend with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React
                    and currently working on
                    server side with Node and
                    Express.

                    was made for me to be able to desgin and create a blog about my expereince in Tokyo.
                    I even made the main logo and wanted to start a blog.
